# v1.2 Backlog

This document tracks the current release stream after v1.1.

## Scope Tracks
1. Public projects discovery (`q`, `stack`, `sort`)
2. Technical SEO pack (`canonical`, JSON-LD, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`)
3. Contact conversion flow (`/contact`, email-only submission)
4. Dashboard productivity (duplicate project + inline sort update)
5. Playwright smoke coverage
6. Harness + system-of-record docs enhancement

## Target Milestones
- Scope lock: February 16, 2026
- Implementation: February 17, 2026 to March 10, 2026
- Stabilization: March 11, 2026 to March 18, 2026
- Release target: March 20, 2026

- Track 3 `Contact conversion flow`: Done
  - Done: `/contact` page + submit flow, validation/anti-spam/throttle, email dispatch, UX polish.
- Track 4 `Dashboard productivity`: Done
  - Done: duplicate project endpoint/action, inline sort update endpoint/action, shared Listbox filter controls, active criteria chips.
- Track 5 `Playwright smoke coverage`: Done
  - Done: public navigation, project detail open, projects filters smoke, contact submit, dashboard auth smoke.
- Track 6 `Harness + system-of-record docs enhancement`: Done
  - Done: harness docs, system-of-record docs, docs-check contract and CI alignment.

## Optimization Stream Progress (Merged)
- `Move /projects filtering/sorting/pagination to SQL`: Done
- `Normalize stack into relational data`: Done
- `Cache stable public payloads`: Done
- `Add DB indexes for admin query patterns`: Done
- `Frontend image loading tuning`: Done
- `CI time optimization (build artifact reuse)`: Done
- `UI optimization pass (shared listbox/chips, partial reload discipline, skeleton tuning, modern project datepicker)`: Done

## Backlog Closure
- v1.2 backlog is complete and ready for release stabilization.
- All scope tracks above are implemented and validated through the current `make check` path.
- Any future tuning work (for example conversion copy/telemetry refinements) should be tracked in the next backlog stream, not in v1.2 scope.
