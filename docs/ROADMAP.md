# Active Roadmap

This file is the active planning surface for upcoming repository work.

## Status
- Current phase: Post-v1.2 stabilization and workflow hardening
- Last updated: February 17, 2026

## Current Priorities
1. Keep documentation and agent workflow contracts synchronized through automated checks.
2. Maintain CI/local parity and deterministic quality-gate behavior.
3. Track new feature streams in this document until promoted to release-specific backlog files.

## Rules
- Do not create new top-level backlog files for completed releases.
- Archive completed milestone backlogs under `docs/archive/`.
- Keep scope and status concise; implementation contracts belong in canonical docs and ADRs.

## Parking Lot
- Future release backlog items should be added here with:
  - objective
  - owner
  - readiness status
